<h2>What Is a Tea Consumption Calculator?</h2>
<p>
A tea consumption calculator is an online tool that calculates the total amount
of tea consumed based on the number of cups per day and number of people.
It provides results for daily, monthly, and yearly tea consumption.
</p>

<h2>Why Track Tea Consumption?</h2>
<p>
Many people drink tea multiple times a day without realizing how much tea they
consume over time. Tracking tea consumption helps in understanding habits,
controlling excessive intake, managing expenses, and planning tea supplies.
</p>

<h2>Daily Tea Consumption</h2>
<p>
Daily tea consumption refers to the number of cups of tea consumed in a single day.
For individuals, this can range from one or two cups to five or more cups.
For families or offices, daily tea consumption can be significantly higher.
</p>

<h2>Monthly Tea Consumption</h2>
<p>
Monthly tea consumption gives a broader view of your tea drinking habits.
By multiplying daily consumption by 30, you can estimate how much tea you drink
in a month. This is useful for budgeting and supply planning.
</p>

<h2>Yearly Tea Consumption</h2>
<p>
Yearly tea consumption highlights long-term habits.
When calculated annually, tea consumption figures often surprise users and
encourage mindful drinking.
</p>

<h2>Tea Consumption in India</h2>

Tea is consumed across all age groups and regions.
Morning tea, evening tea, and tea breaks at work are deeply rooted in Indian culture.
