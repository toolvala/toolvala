<h2>What Is Digital Detox? (Detailed Guide)</h2>
<p>
A <strong>digital detox</strong> is the practice of intentionally reducing or eliminating the use of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and social media platforms for a specific period of time. The goal of a digital detox is not to abandon technology completely, but to regain control over how and when technology is used.
</p>

<p>
Using a <strong>digital detox calculator</strong> helps you measure your current digital habits accurately. Most people underestimate their daily screen time by 30–50%. This screen time calculator reveals the truth and motivates positive change.
</p>

<h2>How Excessive Screen Time Affects Your Brain</h2>
<p>
Excessive screen exposure affects dopamine production in the brain. Social media notifications, likes, and endless scrolling trigger dopamine release, leading to addictive behavior similar to gambling. Over time, this reduces attention span, increases anxiety, and makes it harder to focus on real-life tasks.
</p>

<p>
A phone addiction test like this calculator helps identify early warning signs before serious mental fatigue or burnout occurs.
</p>

<h2>Social Media Addiction Explained</h2>
<p>
Social media platforms are designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible. Infinite scroll, notifications, and algorithmic feeds manipulate attention. This results in unconscious usage habits where people check their phones hundreds of times a day.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>screen time calculator</strong> highlights how many hours are lost daily and yearly due to unnecessary scrolling.
